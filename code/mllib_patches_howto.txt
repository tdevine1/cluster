Create a new maven project called "spark-mllib-patched_2.11"
Setup pom to include:
	- a build command to unpack spark-mllib_2.11 (see pom.xl)
	- spark-mllib_2.11 as a dependency
Create package structure for the files you want to patch
Maven Build "spark-mllib-patched_2.11" once to unpack the class files from spark-mllib_2.11
Eclipse Build to overwrite the class files you have patched.
Maven build to package the unchanged and changed class files together in a jar
Check the jar in Target for modification timestamp of the changed files
	- should be today
Install the jar to your local maven repository:
	- 
Check local maven repo for the new jar with changed class files
	- in $HOME/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-mllib-patched_2.11/2.3.2
Eclipse and Maven build the dependent project

Add to the spark-submit command:
	--conf sparkdriver.userClassPathFirst=true
	--conf sparkexecutor.userClassPathFirst=true
	-jars [PATH TO spark-mllib-patched_2.11.jar]
